## Last Week's Accomplishments

I constructed the getMenu() API, which enables other backend programs to access a list of local pictures address in server of the restaurant input.
I completed most of the getMenu() but the connection part is still a little problematic.

## This Week's Plan

I will try to complete the connection between the server and the database.
I will work on connect() and some helper functions like checkConnection() and reConnect()

## Anything Blocking?
