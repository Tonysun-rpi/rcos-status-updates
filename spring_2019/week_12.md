## Last Week's Accomplishments

I added the usage of DataBase API as comment.
I explain the usage to our backend to make sure he knows how to use it.
Also, I helped building the server environment.

## This Week's Plan

I will help and solve any issues others group members may meet during the build of server.
And I may change and adjust the implementation of DataBase to fix bugs.

## Anything Blocking?
