## Last Week's Accomplishments

I add a private function isDate() to use regExp to check if the input value is a database-named date.
I complete the implementation of updateDate() so client can change the date to whaterver they like.

## This Week's Plan

I will try to implement the getMenu() function so it can be safely used by client.
The thing I may need to do is to check the validity of inputs and get data from database and then arrange the data in a clean way.

## Anything Blocking?
