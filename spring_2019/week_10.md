## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finish the implementation of getMenu() function, so it takes restaurant name and time as input, and it returns a encoded json as the picture addresses.
Also, I fix the bug of initializing mysql table in function updateDate().

## This Week's Plan

I will try to have more tight connection of my database part with other team members' parts, especially the back end.
I may change the implementation of my API to fit others.

## Anything Blocking?
